Project Name- Learning How to Learn
This is a webpage built by using HTML and CSS, it reads on the best ways to learn to help you execute your goals, become more independent, and help you be more productive.
My plans for he future for this project will be, to implemtent new skills I aquire on this, sort of like a sandbox.
